## Introduction

Welcome to my game development project! This repository houses the codebase for an exciting platformer game built using the powerful [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). As a first-time game developer, this project serves as an opportunity to explore the world of game development and gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and techniques.

### Assets and Resources

To ensure a visually appealing and engaging experience, assets have been carefully curated from the renowned [Brackeys Platformer Bundle](https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle). This comprehensive collection includes sprites, tilesets, and other essential resources specifically designed for platformer games.

### GDScript

The game logic and functionality are implemented using GDScript, a high-level, dynamically typed programming language designed specifically for the Godot Engine. GDScript's intuitive syntax and seamless integration with Godot's node-based architecture make it a powerful choice for game development. For in-depth documentation and tutorials on GDScript, please refer to the official [GDScript Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html).

### Getting Started
